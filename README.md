# React Animation Challenge

## Animate a place you love:

- Choose a place in the world you love, perhaps somewhere you can't visit at the moment.
- You're working in pairs, so either decide a place together OR flip a coin to decide.
- Use a react animation library to build and animate a website that celebrates your chosen place.

## Animation libraries:`

- If you are in an odd numbered breakout room use: https://www.framer.com/api/motion/
- If you are in an even numbered breakout room use: https://www.react-spring.io/

## Show your project to another pair:

- At the end of the day we'll share our projects in groups of four.
- Discuss the differences, similarities and quirks of the two animation libraries.
